Ride sharing analysis and visualization for access and affordability

Kitt's Thoughts as we go
So far, the analysis is showing that rural areas have more expensive rides, less drivers for each of those cities, and a lower total fair for those cities. However, an interesting caveat to rule driver affairs being higher may not necessarily be due to the lack of demand, but rather due to the fact that rule areas have father spanning distance from one destination to the next.
