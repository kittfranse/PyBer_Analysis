# PyBer_Analysis
Ride sharing analysis and visualization for access and affordability

Kitt's Thoughts as we go
So far, the analysis is showing that rural areas have more expensive rides, less drivers for each of those cities, and a lower total fair for those cities. However, an interesting caveat to rule driver affairs being higher may not necessarily be due to the lack of demand, but rather due to the fact that rule areas have father spanning distance from one destination to the next.

# Overview
## Purpose of the Analysis

The main purpose of this analysis was to summarize ride-sharing data for mutliple city types, mainly to assess accessibility and utilization of the services.  

# Results

Overall, as a natural consequence of population density for each city type, the data supports the high degree of use for ride-sharing services in the urban area and the low use in the rural areas.  As a consequence, more drivers are available in the urban cities.  The graph generated for 2019 total fares also shows the higher revenue generated by urban cities.

Surprisingly, the average fare and fare per driver is much higher in the rural cities, shown in the code snippet below.

```
avg_fares = total_fares/total_rides
 # this code returns
 
 type
Rural       34.623440
Suburban    30.970128
Urban       24.525772

```

The analysis is showing that rural areas have more expensive rides, less drivers for each of those cities, and a higher total fare for those cities. However, an interesting caveat to rural driver fares being higher may not necessarily be due to the lack of demand, but rather due to the fact that rural areas have father spanning distances from one destination to the next, which is not reflected in this analysis.

# Recommendations

- Reallocating urban and suburban city fares to subsidize rural fares so that PyBer becomes more popular among rural communities, increasing overall use in those areas.
- Incentivize drivers to work in those areas by creating a campaign around the higher rate of fares for rides in rural areas
- Run ads for PyBer in the spring, Mid-February, to take advantage of the increased interest in ride-sharing for the month of March.
